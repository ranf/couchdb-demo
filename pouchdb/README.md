pouchdb-getting-started-todo
============================

Taken from https://github.com/nickcolley/getting-started-todo. Original tutorial at http://pouchdb.com/getting-started.html.

I only added the "completed" view, and a check to prevent displaying design docs as todos.

Since cloud9 only allows a single open port you can either open index.html using Preview button (+Pop Out), or simply download the folder and start an http server (`python -m http.server <port> / python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer <port>`).
